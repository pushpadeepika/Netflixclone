## üßê About

The main purpose of this project is to provide users with a platform to browse and stream their favorite movies and TV shows in a similar way to Netflix. By using the TMDB API, the app can collect movie-related data such as titles, descriptions, ratings, and images, which can be used to display the content on the app.

React.js is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, and its component-based architecture makes it an ideal choice for developing modern web applications. By using React.js, the app can provide a seamless user experience with fast load times and smooth navigation. Overall, the project aims to provide an enjoyable streaming experience for users who want to watch their favorite movies and TV shows online.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get started with building a Netflix clone app using React.js and TMDB API, you will need to have some knowledge of React.js and how to use APIs. Here are some general steps to follow:

Set up your development environment: To build a React.js app, you will need to install Node.js and a package manager such as npm or yarn. Once you have installed these tools, you can create a new React.js project using a command-line tool like create-react-app.

Choose a design template: To make your Netflix clone app look similar to the real Netflix, you can choose a pre-made design template or create your own design. There are several UI component libraries available that can help you build a visually appealing app, such as Material-UI or Bootstrap.

Integrate the TMDB API: To get access to movie data, you will need to integrate the TMDB API into your app. You can use a library like axios to make API requests and fetch data from the TMDB API.

Implement user authentication and authorization: To provide users with a personalized streaming experience, you can implement user authentication and authorization using a service like Firebase. This will allow users to create accounts, log in, and access their watch history and preferences.

Implement search and filter functionality: To make it easy for users to find the movies and TV shows they want to watch, you can implement search and filter functionality. This will allow users to search for titles and filter by genre, release year, and other criteria.

Build the player: To enable users to stream movies and TV shows, you will need to build a player component. There are several video player libraries available for React.js, such as Video.js or ReactPlayer.

Deploy your app: Once your app is ready, you can deploy it to a hosting service like Netlify or Heroku to make it accessible to users.

### Prerequisites

To build a Netflix clone app using React.js and TMDB API, you will need to have a basic understanding of several technologies and concepts. Here are some prerequisites:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: You should have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as they form the foundation for building web applications.

React.js: You will need to have a solid understanding of React.js, including how to use components, state, props, and lifecycle methods. There are several online resources and tutorials available that can help you learn React.js.

API: You should have a basic understanding of how APIs work and how to make API requests using tools like axios.

### Installing

To build a Netflix clone app using React.js and TMDB API, you will need to install several tools and dependencies. Here are the main requirements:
Package manager: npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn are package managers that allow you to install and manage dependencies for your project. You can use either of these package managers to install the required dependencies for your React.js app.

React.js: You will need to install React.js to build your app. React.js is available as an npm package, and you can install it by running the command: npm install react or yarn add react

React Router: React Router is a library that allows you to handle client-side routing in your React.js app. You can install React Router by running the command: npm install react-router-dom or yarn add react-router-dom

Axios: Axios is a library that allows you to make HTTP requests to the TMDB API to fetch movie data. You can install Axios by running the command: npm install axios or yarn add axios

Firebase: Firebase is a platform that provides several services, including user authentication and authorization. You can use Firebase to implement user authentication in your app. You can install Firebase by running the command: npm install firebase or yarn add firebase

## üîß Running the tests

To run automated tests for a Netflix clone app built with React.js and TMDB API, you can use testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library. Here are the general steps to run automated tests:

Install Jest and React Testing Library: You can install Jest and React Testing Library as dev dependencies using npm or yarn. Run the command npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom or yarn add --dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

Write test cases: You can write test cases for your components and other parts of your app using Jest and React Testing Library. For example, you can test if a component renders correctly, if user interactions work as expected, and if API requests return the correct data.

Create a test script: In the package.json file, create a script for running tests. The script could be something like "test": "jest"

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Here are some notes on how to use the Netflix clone app built with React.js and TMDB API:

Home page: The home page displays a list of popular movies and TV shows. You can click on a movie or TV show to view more details, or use the search bar to search for a specific movie or TV show.

Sign up and login: To access certain features of the app, such as creating a watchlist or leaving a review, you need to sign up and login. You can create an account by clicking the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner of the app. After you create an account, you can log in by clicking the "Log In" button.

Movie and TV show details: When you click on a movie or TV show, you can view more details such as the plot summary, cast, and user reviews. You can also add the movie or TV show to your watchlist, leave a review, or rate the movie or TV show.

## üöÄ Deployment

To deploy the Netflix clone app built with React.js and TMDB API on a live system, you can use a cloud hosting service such as Firebase, AWS, or Google Cloud. Here are some steps to deploy the app using Firebase:

Create a Firebase project: Create a new Firebase project and select the "Web" option to add the app to the project.

Install Firebase CLI: Install the Firebase CLI using npm or yarn. Run the command npm install -g firebase-tools or yarn global add firebase-tools

Configure Firebase: In the Firebase console, go to the "Project Settings" and copy the Firebase configuration code. Paste this code into a new file named .env.local in the root directory of your app.

Build the app: Run the command npm run build or yarn build to create a production build of your app.

Initialize Firebase: Run the command firebase login to log in to your Firebase account. Then run the command firebase init to initialize Firebase for your app. Follow the prompts to select the Firebase project and configure the app.

Deploy the app: Run the command firebase deploy to deploy the app to Firebase hosting. The app will be live at the URL specified in the Firebase hosting settings.
